2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
The fundamental reasons behind the success of cloud computing include scalability, cost efficiency, and accessibility.
Pros:
	1.Scalability
	2.Cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go)
	3.Accessibility (available anywhere with internet)
Cons:
	4.Security concerns
	5.Downtime or reliability issues
	6.Data privacy risks



3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
The primary function of a hypervisor is to create, manage, and run virtual machines by separating the physical hardware from the operating systems.



4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications independently.



5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
	1.Better hardware utilization
	2.Easy backup and recovery
	3.Isolation and security
	4.Portability
	5.Cost efficiency


6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
	1.Software testing and development
	2.Running multiple OS environments
	3.Server consolidation
	4.Disaster recovery
	5.Cloud computing infrastructure


7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine.



8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.


9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.



10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
The purpose of cloning a virtual machine is to create an exact copy of an existing VM for testing, backup, or deployment purposes.
